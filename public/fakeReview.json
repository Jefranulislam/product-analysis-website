I replied and told him that I know what I'm doing and that it loses its connection to my network and the only way to reconnect it is to unplug it and go through the setup process every other day. Why won't it remember the settings and why is it constantly dropping?  I never heard back from Amazon after I explained this to them. I would throw this Echo in the lake if my wife would let me. A waste of $180.",

After reading the reviews I see there are many people having trouble with the power cord. I tried unplugging the Echo for 15 seconds, held the reset button on the bottom for 15 seconds yet nothing works. Seems there is a problem with the power cord. Why is it so hard to communicate with Amazon through their website? they keep the \"contact us\" link hidden from the public. I have looked everywhere and see nothing for live support or a phone number. WTF?",
